    <h2>History Of India</h2>
    <p>The history of India includes the prehistoric settlements and societies in the Indian subcontinent; the
        advancement of civilisation from the Indus Valley Civilisation to the eventual blending of the Indo-Aryan
        culture to form the Vedic Civilisation; the rise of Hinduism, Jainism and Buddhism; the onset of a succession of
        powerful dynasties and empires for more than three millennia throughout various geographic areas of the Indian
        subcontinent, including the growth of Muslim dominions during the Medieval period intertwined with Hindu powers;
        the advent of European traders and privateers, resulting in the establishment of British India; and the
        subsequent independence movement that led to the Partition of India and the creation of the Republic of
        India</p>

    <p>The most significant event between the 7th and 11th century was the Tripartite struggle centred on Kannauj that
        lasted for more than two centuries between the Pala Empire, Rashtrakuta Empire, and Gurjara-Pratihara Empire.
        Muslim rule started in parts of north India in the 13th century when the Delhi Sultanate was founded in 1206 CE
        by Central Asian Turks;The Delhi Sultanate ruled the major part of northern India in the early 14th century, but
        declined in the late 14th century. This period also saw the emergence of several powerful Hindu states, notably
        Vijayanagara, Gajapati, Ahom, as well as Rajput states, such as Mewar. The 15th century saw the advent of
        Sikhism. The early modern period began in the 16th century, when the Mughals conquered most of the Indian
        subcontinent. The Mughals suffered a gradual decline in the early 18th century, which provided opportunities for
        the Marathas, Sikhs and Mysoreans to exercise control over large areas of the Indian subcontinent.</p>
    <p>From the late 18th century to the mid-19th century, large areas of India were annexed by the British East India
        Company of the British Empire. Dissatisfaction with Company rule led to the Indian Rebellion of 1857, after
        which the British provinces of India were directly administered by the British Crown and witnessed a period of
        rapid development of infrastructure, economic decline and major famines. During the first half of the 20th
        century, a nationwide struggle for independence was launched with the leading party involved being the Indian
        National Congress which was later joined by other organisations. The Indian subcontinent gained independence
        from the United Kingdom in 1947, after the British provinces were partitioned into the dominions of India and
        Pakistan and the princely states all acceded to one of the new states.</p>

    <h2>Ancient History Of India</h2>
    <p>India's history and culture is dynamic, spanning back to the beginning of human civilization. It begins with a
        mysterious culture along the Indus River and in farming communities in the southern lands of India. The history
        of India is punctuated by constant integration of migrating people with the diverse cultures that surround
        India. Available evidence suggests that the use of iron, copper and other metals was widely prevalent in the
        Indian sub-continent at a fairly early period, which is indicative of the progress that this part of the world
        had made. By the end of the fourth millennium BC, India had emerged as a region of highly developed
        civilization.</p>

    <h3>Vedic Civilization</h3>
    The Vedic civilization is the earliest civilization in the history of ancient India. It is named after the Vedas,
    the early literature of the Hindu people. The Vedic Civilization flourished along the river Saraswati, in a region
    that now consists of the modern Indian states of Haryana and Punjab. Vedic is synonymous with Hinduism, which is
    another name for religious and spiritual thought that has evolved from the Vedas.

    The Ramayana and Mahabharata were the two great epics of this period.
    <h3>The Indus Valley Civilization</h3>
    The History of India begins with the birth of the Indus Valley Civilization, more precisely known as Harappan
    Civilization. It flourished around 2,500 BC, in the western part of South Asia, what today is Pakistan and Western
    India. The Indus Valley was home to the largest of the four ancient urban civilizations of Egypt, Mesopotamia, India
    and China. Nothing was known about this civilization till 1920s when the Archaeological Department of India carried
    out excavations in the Indus valley wherein the ruins of the two old cities, viz. Mohenjodaro and Harappa were
    unearthed. The ruins of buildings and other things like household articles, weapons of war, gold and silver
    ornaments, seals, toys, pottery wares, etc., show that some four to five thousand years ago a highly developed
    Civilization flourished in this region.

    The Indus valley civilization was basically an urban civilization and the people lived in well-planned and
    well-built towns, which were also the centers for trade. The ruins of Mohenjodaro and Harappa show that these were
    magnificent merchant cities-well planned, scientifically laid, and well looked after. They had wide roads and a
    well-developed drainage system. The houses were made of baked bricks and had two or more storeys.

    The highly civilized Harappans knew the art of growing cereals, and wheat and barley constituted their staple food.
    They consumed vegetables and fruits and ate mutton, pork and eggs as well. Evidences also show that they wore cotton
    as well as woollen garments. By 1500 BC, the Harappan culture came to an end. Among various causes ascribed to the
    decay of Indus Valley Civilization are the recurrent floods and other natural causes like earthquake, etc.

<div id="Medieval-History">
    <h2>Medieval History Of India</h2>
    <p>For a period that has come to be so strongly associated with the Islamic influence and rule in India, Medieval
        Indian history went for almost three whole centuries under the so-called indigenous rulers, that included the
        Chalukyas, the Pallavas, the Pandyas, the Rashtrakutas, the Muslims rulers(Delhi Dynasty) and finally the Mughal
        Empire. The most important dynasty to emerge in the middle of the 9th century was that of the Cholas.</p>
    <p>
    <h3>The Delhi Sultanate</h3>
    The Delhi Sultanate was a major Muslim sultanate from the 13th to the 16th century in India. The period between 1206
    A.D. and 1526 A.D. in India's history is known as the Delhi Sultanate period. During this period of over three
    hundred years, five dynasties ruled in Delhi. These were: the Slave dynasty (1206-90), Khilji dynasty (1290-1320),
    Tughlaq dynasty (1320-1413), Sayyid dynasty (1414-51), and Lodhi dynasty (1451-1526)</p>

    <p>It began with the campaigns of Muḥammad of Ghūr and his lieutenant Quṭb al-Dīn Aibak primarily between 1175 and
        1206. The Delhi Sultanate was administrated and governed as per the laws stated in the holy Quran. This Quranic
        law was the supreme law of the empire. During and in the Delhi Sultanate, there was a synthesis of Indian
        civilization with that of Islamic civilization, and the further integration of the Indian subcontinent with a
        growing world system and wider international networks spanning large parts of Afro-Eurasia, which had a
        significant impact on Indian culture and society, as well as the wider world. The time of their rule included
        the earliest forms of Indo-Islamic architecture, increased growth rates in India's population and economy, and
        the emergence of the Hindi-Urdu language. The Delhi Sultanate was also responsible for repelling the Mongol
        Empire's potentially devastating invasions of India in the 13th and 14th centuries. In 1526,the Sultanate was
        conquered and succeeded by the Mughal Empire.</p>
    <p>
    <h3>The Mughal Empire</h3>
    In India, the Mughal Empire was one of the greatest empires ever. The Mughal Empire ruled hundreds of millions of
    people. India became united under one rule, and had very prosperous cultural and political years during the Mughal
    rule. There were many Muslim and Hindu kingdoms split all throughout India until the founders of the Mughal Empire
    came. There were some men such as Babar, grandson to the Great Asian conqueror Tamerlane and the conqueror Genghis
    Khan from the northern region of Ganges, river valley, who decided to take over Khyber, and eventually, all of
    India. the rulers of Mughal Empire are: The dynasty was founded by a Chagatai Turkic prince named Bābur (reigned
    1526–30),Bābur’s son Humāyūn (reigned 1530–40 and 1555–56) lost control of the empire to Afghan rebels, but
    Humāyūn’s son Akbar (reigned 1556–1605), jehangir (1605-1627) Shah Jahan(1628-1657),Aurangzeb(1658-1707), after his
    death the Mughal Empire begin to Collapse.</p>

<!-- Arrival of Europeans-->
<div id="Arrival-of-Europeans">
    <h2>Arrival Of Europeans In India</h2>
    <p>The geo­graphical discoveries of the last quarter of the 15th century deeply affected the commercial relations of
        the different countries of the world and produced far-reaching consequences. The discovery of a new all-sea
        route from Europe to India via Cape of Good Hope by Vasco da Gama had far-reaching reper­cussions on the
        civilised world.
        The arrival of the Portuguese in India was followed by the advent of other European communities like,
        Dutch,French and English Traders. Then India’s coastal and maritime trade was monopolized by the Europeans.The
        European merchants who came to India during this period differed from the earlier foreign merchants and had the
        political and military support of their respective governments.</p>
    <p>
    <h3>Arrival of Portuguese in India</h3>
    It was the Portuguese who first discovered a direct sea route to India. Portuguese sailor Vasco da Gama arrived at
    Calicut an important sea port located on the South-West India on May 20, 1498 AD. King Zamorin, the local rule
    received him and bestowed on him certain privileges. After staying in India for a period of three months Vasco da
    Gama returned with a rich cargo which he sold in the European market at an exorbitant price- 60 times the cost of
    his voyage.
    But soon Vasco da Gama came back to India for the second time in 1501 AD. He set up a trading factory at Cannanore.
    With establishment of trade links, Calicut, Cannanore and Cochin emerged the significant Portuguese centers in
    India. Arab traders became jealous of the rise and success of the Portuguese and hence caused enmity bred between
    the Portuguese and the local king Zamorin. The hostilities grew and led to full- fledged military face- off between
    them. King Zamorin was defeated by the Portuguese. With the victory over Zamorin, the military superiority of the
    Portuguese was established.</p>
    <p>In 1505 AD, Francisco de Almeida was appointed as the first Portuguese governor in India. His policy being
        centric to controlling the Indian Ocean was known as the Blue Water Policy. Alfonso de Albuquerque who replaced
        Almeida as the governor in 1509 AD, and captured Goa from the Sultan of Bijapur in 1510 AD is considered the
        real founder of the Portuguese power in India. Goa subsequently became the headquarters of the Portuguese
        settlements in India. Portuguese hold over the coastal areas and superiority in naval power helped them
        significantly. By the end of the 16th century, the Portuguese captured not only Goa, Daman, Diu, and Salsette
        but also a vast stretches along the Indian coast.</p>

    <h3>Arrival of the British</h3>
    Arrival of the British and the establishment of British East India Company was the outcome of the Portuguese traders
    who earn enormous profit by selling their merchandise in India. Being motivated by the successful business stories
    of the Portuguese a group of English merchants -‘Merchant Adventurers’ formed a company- the East India Company in
    1599 AD. The Company received a royal charter from Queen Elizabeth I on December 31, 1600 AD authorizing it to trade
    in the East. Queen was herself a share holder in the East India Company.
    Subsequently in 1608 AD, the East India Company sent Captain William Hawkins to the court of the Mughal emperor
    Jahangir to secure royal patronage. He succeeded in getting royal permit for the Company to establish its factories
    at various places on the Western coast of India. Then in 1615 AD, Sir Thomas Roe was sent by Emperor James I of
    England to Jahangir’s court, with a plea for more concession for the Company. Roe was very diplomatic and thus
    successfully secured a royal charter giving the Company freedom to trade in the whole of the Mughal territory.
    After establishing its factories in south and west India, the company started to focus on east India particularly
    Bengal a significant province Mughal empire. The governor of Bengal Sujauddaula in 1651 AD, allowed the English
    Company to carry out its trade activities in Bengal. A factory in Hugli was established and three villages
    -Sutanati, Govindapur and Kolkata- were purchased in 1698 AD by the Company to build a factory over there.
    Subsequently Fort William was raised in order to provide protection around the factory.

<div id="Revolt-of-1857">
    <h2>The Revolt Of 1857</h2>
    <p>
    <h3>First War Of Independence</h3>
    By the first half of the 19th century, the East India Company had brought major portions of India under its control.
    One hundred years after the Battle of Plassey, anger against the unjust and oppressive British Government took the
    form of a revolt that shook the very foundations of British rule in India.While British historians called it the
    Sepoy Mutiny, Indian historians named it the Revolt of 1857 or the First War of Indian Independence. The Revolt of
    1857 had been preceded by a series of disturbances in different parts of the country from the late eighteenth
    century onwards.
    The Sanyasi Rebellion in North Bengal and the Chunar rebellion in Bihar and Bengal broke out in the late eighteenth
    century. There were several peasant uprisings in the mid- nineteenth century, the most important of which were those
    by the Moplah peasants of the Malabar and the Faraizi movement by Muslim peasants in Bengal.
    The first half of the nineteenth century also witnessed a number of tribal revolts. In this context, mention may be
    made of the rebellions of the Bhils of Madhya Pradesh, the Santhals of Bihar and the Gonds and Khonds of Orissa.
    However, all these disturbances were localized. Although serious and, in some cases, long drawn, these did not pose
    any serious threat to the existence of the British Empire.
    The first expression of organised resistance was the Revolt of 1857. It began as a revolt of the sepoys of the
    Company’s army but eventually secured the participation of the masses. Its causes lay deeply embedded in the
    grievances that all sections of Indian society nurtured against the British rule.

    <p>The Revolt of 1857 started as a sepoy mutiny. It was only later on that other elements of society joined the
        revolt. The extension of the British Empire in India had adversely affected the service conditions of Indian
        sepoys. They were required to serve in areas far away from their homes. In 1856 Lord Canning issued the General
        Services Enlistment Act which required that the sepoys must be ready to serve even in British land across the
        sea.
        The Revolt of 1857 eventually broke out over the incident of greased cartridges. A rumour spread that the
        cartridges of the new Enfield rifles were greased with the fat of cows and pigs. Before loading these rifles the
        sepoys had to bite off the paper on the cartridges. Both Hindu and Muslim sepoys refused to use them. Canning
        tried to make amends for the error and the offending cartridges were withdrawn, but by then the damage had been
        done. There was unrest in several places
        In March 1857, Mangal Pandey, a sepoy in Barrackpore, had refused to use the cartridge and attacked his senior
        officers. He was hanged to death on 8th April. On 9th May, 85 soldiers in Meerut refused to use the new rifle
        and were sentenced to ten years’ imprisonment.
